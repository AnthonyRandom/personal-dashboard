Todo List for AI Dashboard Development

 
Core Setup

 Configure ESLint and TypeScript rules for strict type checking
 Set up Prettier for consistent code formatting
 Verify Vite build and development scripts are functional
 Ensure Tailwind CSS is properly integrated with index.css


 
UI Components

 Implement AIHomepage component for the homepage (Index.tsx)
 Create reusable widget wrapper component for consistent styling
 Style all shadcn/ui components to match light/dark themes
 Add hover and focus states for all interactive elements
 Ensure ARIA attributes are applied to all custom components


 
Sidebar Enhancements

 Add tooltip support for collapsed sidebar icons
 Implement persistent sidebar state (save expanded/collapsed preference)
 Add keyboard navigation for sidebar menu items
 Optimize sidebar animations for smoother transitions


 
Dashboard Functionality

 Implement drag-and-drop for widgets using react-resizable-panels
 Add widget resizing functionality
 Create a widget store to manage available widgets
 Implement "Add Widget" button logic to dynamically add widgets
 Add remove widget functionality with confirmation dialog


 
Task Management

 Replace static task data with dynamic data (local storage or API)
 Implement task creation form with react-hook-form and zod validation
 Add task editing and deletion functionality
 Support task categories or priorities
 Add task filtering (e.g., completed, pending)


 
Module Pages

 Implement WeatherPage with mock weather data
 Implement CalendarPage with react-day-picker event management
 Implement NewsPage with mock news data
 Implement HealthPage with mock health metrics
 Implement ProductivityPage with recharts visualizations
 Implement FinancePage with budget tracking
 Implement JournalPage with rich text editor
 Implement InsightsPage with mock AI insights
 Implement SocialPage with mock social feed
 Style all module pages to match dashboard theme


 
Search Functionality

 Implement global search logic to query tasks, events, and journal entries
 Add search result highlighting
 Support keyboard shortcuts for search activation


 
Notifications

 Implement toast notification system for task reminders
 Add notification dismissal and persistence
 Support notification categories (e.g., tasks, calendar events)


 
Theme Management

 Persist theme preference in local storage
 Add system theme detection (light/dark based on OS settings)
 Ensure all components respond to theme changes


 
Data Management

 Set up react-query for caching static data
 Create mock API endpoints for testing
 Implement error handling for failed API calls
 Add loading states for all data-driven components


 
API Integrations

 Integrate weather API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap) for WeatherPage
 Integrate news API (e.g., NewsAPI) for NewsPage
 Integrate xAI Grok API for InsightsPage
 Set up API key management with environment variables
 Implement retry logic for API failures


 
Accessibility

 Test all components with screen readers (e.g., NVDA, VoiceOver)
 Ensure keyboard navigation for all interactive elements
 Verify WCAG 2.1 AA compliance using Lighthouse
 Add high-contrast mode support


 
Performance Optimizations

 Implement lazy loading for module pages with React.lazy and Suspense
 Optimize bundle size with tree-shaking
 Add code-splitting for large components
 Profile and optimize widget rendering performance


 
Testing

 Write unit tests for core components using Jest or Vitest
 Add integration tests for routing and data fetching
 Test cross-browser compatibility (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
 Perform accessibility testing with automated tools
 Test responsive design on mobile and tablet viewports


 
Documentation

 Document component props and usage in README
 Create API documentation for mock endpoints
 Add code comments for complex logic
 Update TechSpec.md with any new implementation details
