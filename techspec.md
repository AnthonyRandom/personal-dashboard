Technical Specification for AI Dashboard
1. Overview
1.1 Purpose
This Technical Specification document outlines the technical architecture, implementation details, and requirements for the AI Dashboard, a React-based web application designed to serve as a personal assistant. The application integrates modules for task management, weather, calendar, news, health, productivity, finance, journaling, AI insights, and social features, built with Vite, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and shadcn/ui components.
1.2 Scope
The AI Dashboard is a client-side, single-page application (SPA) with a modular, widget-based dashboard. It supports responsive design, light/dark mode switching, and extensible architecture for future API integrations. This document covers the frontend architecture, component structure, dependencies, and technical requirements based on the provided codebase.

4. Component Implementation Details
4.1 App.tsx

Purpose: Root component for routing and global providers.
Providers:
QueryClientProvider: Manages data fetching with react-query.
TooltipProvider: Enables tooltips across the app.
BrowserRouter: Handles client-side routing.


Routes:
/: Renders `Index Ditto
/tasks, /weather, /calendar, etc.: Render respective pages.
*: Renders NotFound for invalid routes.



4.2 Dashboard.tsx

Purpose: Main layout with header, sidebar trigger, and widget area.
Components:
SidebarProvider: Manages sidebar state (expanded/collapsed).
SidebarTrigger: Toggles sidebar visibility.
Input: Search bar with Search icon.
Button: Notification bell and "Add Widget" button.
DashboardOverview: Container for widgets.


Styles: Uses Tailwind CSS with sticky header and responsive layout.

4.3 AppSidebar.tsx

Purpose: Collapsible navigation sidebar.
Features:
Navigation links using NavLink for routing.
Theme toggle with next-themes to switch between light and dark modes.
Collapsible state managed by useSidebar hook.


Icons: Lucide icons for each navigation item and theme toggle.
Styles: Tailwind CSS with transition animations for collapse/expand.

4.4 TasksWidget.tsx

Purpose: Displays a subset of tasks with completion status.
Data: Static task array (to be replaced with API data).
Components:
Checkbox: Toggles task completion.
Button: Adds new tasks (placeholder functionality).


Styles: Tailwind CSS with animations (animate-scale-in).

4.5 Index.tsx

Purpose: Entry point for the homepage.
Component: Renders AIHomepage (to be implemented with widgets or static content).

5. Data Management

Library: react-query for fetching and caching data.
Current State: Uses static data (e.g., tasks array in TasksWidget.tsx).
Future Integration:
API endpoints for weather, news, and AI insights (e.g., xAI’s Grok API).
Caching strategy: Cache data for 5 minutes with react-query.


Validation: zod schemas for form inputs and API responses.

6. Styling and UI

Framework: Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui components.
Features:
Responsive design for mobile, tablet, and desktop.
Dark/light mode support via next-themes.
Animations using tailwindcss-animate (e.g., animate-scale-in for widgets).


Icons: lucide-react for consistent iconography.
Components: shadcn/ui primitives (e.g., Button, Input, Checkbox) for accessibility and consistency.

7. Future Enhancements

API Integrations:
Weather API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap) for WeatherPage.
News API (e.g., NewsAPI) for NewsPage.
xAI Grok API (https://x.ai/api) for InsightsPage.


Dynamic Widgets: Implement react-resizable-panels for drag-and-drop and resizing.
Offline Support: Use react-query offline caching.
Performance: Code-split modules with React.lazy and Suspense.

8. Testing and Validation

Linting: ESLint with eslint-plugin-react-hooks and eslint-plugin-react-refresh.
Type Checking: TypeScript with strict mode.
Unit Testing: To be implemented with Jest or Vitest.
Browser Testing: Test on Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge.
Accessibility Testing: Use tools like Lighthouse to ensure WCAG compliance.

9. Deployment

Build Process: vite build for production, outputting to dist/.
Hosting: Deployable on Netlify, Vercel, or similar platforms.
CDN: Use CDN for static assets to reduce load times.
Environment Variables:
VITE_API_KEY: For future API integrations.
VITE_BASE_URL: For API endpoint configuration.



10. Assumptions and Constraints

Assumptions:
Users have modern browsers.
API integrations will be available for weather, news, and AI insights.


Constraints:
Client-side rendering only (no SSR).
No local file I/O (browser-based execution).
Limited to mock data until APIs are integrated.



11. Risks and Mitigation

Risk: Large bundle size impacting load time.
Mitigation: Use code-splitting and tree-shaking with Vite.


Risk: Browser inconsistencies.
Mitigation: Leverage shadcn/ui’s cross-browser components and test thoroughly.


Risk: API integration delays.
Mitigation: Use mock data and implement fallback UI states.
